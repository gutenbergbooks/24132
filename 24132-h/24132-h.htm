    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote, as the huge menacing mass of New York defined itself far off
      across the waters, shrank back into her corner of the deck and sat
      listening with a kind of unreasoning terror to the steady onward drive of
      the screws.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had set out on the voyage quietly enough,&mdash;in what she called her
      &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; mood,&mdash;but the week at sea had given her too much time
      to think of things and had left her too long alone with the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was alone, it was always the past that occupied her. She couldn&rsquo;t
      get away from it, and she didn&rsquo;t any longer care to. During her long years
      of exile she had made her terms with it, had learned to accept the fact
      that it would always be there, huge, obstructing, encumbering, bigger and
      more dominant than anything the future could ever conjure up. And, at any
      rate, she was sure of it, she understood it, knew how to reckon with it;
      she had learned to screen and manage and protect it as one does an
      afflicted member of one&rsquo;s family.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had never been any danger of her being allowed to forget the past.
      It looked out at her from the face of every acquaintance, it appeared
      suddenly in the eyes of strangers when a word enlightened them: &ldquo;Yes, <i>the</i>
      Mrs. Lidcote, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; It had sprung at her the first day out,
      when, across the dining-room, from the captain&rsquo;s table, she had seen Mrs.
      Lorin Boulger&rsquo;s revolving eye-glass pause and the eye behind it grow as
      blank as a dropped blind. The next day, of course, the captain had asked:
      &ldquo;You know your ambassadress, Mrs. Boulger?&rdquo; and she had replied that, No,
      she seldom left Florence, and hadn&rsquo;t been to Rome for more than a day
      since the Boulgers had been sent to Italy. She was so used to these
      phrases that it cost her no effort to repeat them. And the captain had
      promptly changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she didn&rsquo;t, as a rule, mind the past, because she was used to it and
      understood it. It was a great concrete fact in her path that she had to
      walk around every time she moved in any direction. But now, in the light
      of the unhappy event that had summoned her from Italy,&mdash;the sudden
      unanticipated news of her daughter&rsquo;s divorce from Horace Pursh and
      remarriage with Wilbour Barkley&mdash;the past, her own poor miserable
      past, started up at her with eyes of accusation, became, to her disordered
      fancy, like the afflicted relative suddenly breaking away from nurses and
      keepers and publicly parading the horror and misery she had, all the long
      years, so patiently screened and secluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there it had stood before her through the agitated weeks since the
      news had come&mdash;during her interminable journey from India, where
      Leila&rsquo;s letter had overtaken her, and the feverish halt in her apartment
      in Florence, where she had had to stop and gather up her possessions for a
      fresh start&mdash;there it had stood grinning at her with a new
      balefillness which seemed to say: &ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;ve got to look at me <i>now</i>,
      because I&rsquo;m not only your own past but Leila&rsquo;s present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly it was a master-stroke of those arch-ironists of the shears and
      spindle to duplicate her own story in her daughter&rsquo;s. Mrs. Lidcote had
      always somewhat grimly fancied that, having so signally failed to be of
      use to Leila in other ways, she would at least serve her as a warning. She
      had even abstained from defending herself, from making the best of her
      case, had stoically refused to plead extenuating circumstances, lest
      Leila&rsquo;s impulsive sympathy should lead to deductions that might react
      disastrously on her own life. And now that very thing had happened, and
      Mrs. Lidcote could hear the whole of New York saying with one voice: &ldquo;Yes,
      Leila&rsquo;s done just what her mother did. With such an example what could you
      expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet if she had been an example, poor woman, she had been an awful one; she
      had been, she would have supposed, of more use as a deterrent than a
      hundred blameless mothers as incentives. For how could any one who had
      seen anything of her life in the last eighteen years have had the courage
      to repeat so disastrous an experiment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, logic in such cases didn&rsquo;t count, example didn&rsquo;t count, nothing
      probably counted but having the same impulses in the blood; and that was
      the dark inheritance she had bestowed upon her daughter. Leila hadn&rsquo;t
      consciously copied her; she had simply &ldquo;taken after&rdquo; her, had been a
      projection of her own long-past rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote had deplored, when she started, that the <i>Utopia</i> was a
      slow steamer, and would take eight full days to bring her to her unhappy
      daughter; but now, as the moment of reunion approached, she would
      willingly have turned the boat about and fled back to the high seas. It
      was not only because she felt still so unprepared to face what New York
      had in store for her, but because she needed more time to dispose of what
      the <i>Utopia</i> had already given her. The past was bad enough, but the
      present and future were worse, because they were less comprehensible, and
      because, as she grew older, surprises and inconsequences troubled her more
      than the worst certainties.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Mrs. Boulger, for instance. In the light, or rather the
      darkness, of new developments, it might really be that Mrs. Boulger had
      not meant to cut her, but had simply failed to recognize her. Mrs. Lidcote
      had arrived at this hypothesis simply by listening to the conversation of
      the persons sitting next to her on deck&mdash;two lively young women with
      the latest Paris hats on their heads and the latest New York ideas in
      them. These ladies, as to whom it would have been impossible for a person
      with Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s old-fashioned categories to determine whether they
      were married or unmarried, &ldquo;nice&rdquo; or &ldquo;horrid,&rdquo; or any one or other of the
      definite things which young women, in her youth and her society, were
      conveniently assumed to be, had revealed a familiarity with the world of
      New York that, again according to Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s traditions, should have
      implied a recognized place in it. But in the present fluid state of
      manners what did anything imply except what their hats implied&mdash;that
      no one could tell what was coming next?
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed, at any rate, to frequent a group of idle and opulent people
      who executed the same gestures and revolved on the same pivots as Mrs.
      Lidcote&rsquo;s daughter and her friends: their Coras, Matties and Mabels seemed
      at any moment likely to reveal familiar patronymics, and once one of the
      speakers, summing up a discussion of which Mrs. Lidcote had missed the
      beginning, had affirmed with headlong confidence: &ldquo;Leila? Oh, <i>Leila&rsquo;s</i>
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could it be <i>her</i> Leila, the mother had wondered, with a sharp thrill
      of apprehension? If only they would mention surnames! But their talk
      leaped elliptically from allusion to allusion, their unfinished sentences
      dangled over bottomless pits of conjecture, and they gave their bewildered
      hearer the impression not so much of talking only of their intimates, as
      of being intimate with every one alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her old friend Franklin Ide could have told her, perhaps; but here was the
      last day of the voyage, and she hadn&rsquo;t yet found courage to ask him. Great
      as had been the joy of discovering his name on the passenger-list and
      seeing his friendly bearded face in the throng against the taffrail at
      Cherbourg, she had as yet said nothing to him except, when they had met:
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m going out to Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said nothing to Franklin Ide because she had always instinctively
      shrunk from taking him into her confidence. She was sure he felt sorry for
      her, sorrier perhaps than any one had ever felt; but he had always paid
      her the supreme tribute of not showing it. His attitude allowed her to
      imagine that compassion was not the basis of his feeling for her, and it
      was part of her joy in his friendship that it was the one relation
      seemingly unconditioned by her state, the only one in which she could
      think and feel and behave like any other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, as the problem of New York loomed nearer, she began to
      regret that she had not spoken, had not at least questioned him about the
      hints she had gathered on the way. He did not know the two ladies next to
      her, he did not even, as it chanced, know Mrs. Lorin Boulger; but he knew
      New York, and New York was the sphinx whose riddle she must read or
      perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as the thought passed through her mind his stooping shoulders and
      grizzled head detached themselves against the blaze of light in the west,
      and he sauntered down the empty deck and dropped into the chair at her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re expecting the Barkleys to meet you, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time she had heard any one pronounce her daughter&rsquo;s new
      name, and it occurred to her that her friend, who was shy and
      inarticulate, had been trying to say it all the way over and had at last
      shot it out at her only because he felt it must be now or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I cabled, of course. But I believe she&rsquo;s at&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      at&mdash;<i>his</i> place somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barkley&rsquo;s; yes, near Lenox, isn&rsquo;t it? But she&rsquo;s sure to come to town
      to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it so easily and naturally that her own constraint was relieved,
      and suddenly, before she knew what she meant to do, she had burst out:
      &ldquo;She may dislike the idea of seeing people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide, whose absent short-sighted gaze had been fixed on the slowly gliding
      water, turned in his seat to stare at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Leila?&rdquo; he said with an incredulous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote flushed to her faded hair and grew pale again. &ldquo;It took <i>me</i>
      a long time&mdash;to get used to it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His look grew gently commiserating. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find&mdash;&rdquo; he paused
      for a word&mdash;&ldquo;that things are different now&mdash;altogether easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been wondering&mdash;ever since we started.&rdquo; She was
      determined now to speak. She moved nearer, so that their arms touched, and
      she could drop her voice to a murmur. &ldquo;You see, it all came on me in a
      flash. My going off to India and Siam on that long trip kept me away from
      letters for weeks at a time; and she didn&rsquo;t want to tell me beforehand&mdash;oh,
      I understand <i>that</i>, poor child! You know how good she&rsquo;s always been
      to me; how she&rsquo;s tried to spare me. And she knew, of course, what a state
      of horror I&rsquo;d be in. She knew I&rsquo;d rush off to her at once and try to stop
      it. So she never gave me a hint of anything, and she even managed to
      muzzle Susy Suffern&mdash;you know Susy is the one of the family who keeps
      me informed about things at home. I don&rsquo;t yet see how she prevented Susy&rsquo;s
      telling me; but she did. And her first letter, the one I got up at
      Bangkok, simply said the thing was over&mdash;the divorce, I mean&mdash;and
      that the very next day she&rsquo;d&mdash;well, I suppose there was no use
      waiting; and <i>he</i> seems to have behaved as well as possible, to have
      wanted to marry her as much as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Barkley?&rdquo; he helped her out. &ldquo;I should say so! Why what do you
      suppose&mdash;&rdquo; He interrupted himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be devoted to her, I assure
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course; I&rsquo;m sure he will. He&rsquo;s written me&mdash;really
      beautifully. But it&rsquo;s a terrible strain on a man&rsquo;s devotion. I&rsquo;m not sure
      that Leila realizes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide sounded again his little reassuring laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that you
      realize. <i>They&rsquo;re</i> all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the very phrase that the young lady in the next seat had applied to
      the unknown &ldquo;Leila,&rdquo; and its recurrence on Ide&rsquo;s lips flushed Mrs. Lidcote
      with fresh courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew just what you mean. The two young women next to me&mdash;the
      ones with the wonderful hats&mdash;have been talking in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? About Leila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About <i>a</i> Leila; I fancied it might be mine. And about society in
      general. All their friends seem to be divorced; some of them seem to
      announce their engagements before they get their decree. One of them&mdash;<i>her</i>
      name was Mabel&mdash;as far as I could make out, her husband found out
      that she meant to divorce him by noticing that she wore a new
      engagement-ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see Leila did everything &lsquo;regularly,&rsquo; as the French say,&rdquo; Ide
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but are these people in society? The people my neighbours talk
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It would take an arbitration commission a good
      many sittings to define the boundaries of society nowadays. But at any
      rate they&rsquo;re in New York; and I assure you you&rsquo;re <i>not</i>; you&rsquo;re
      farther and farther from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been back there several times to see Leila.&rdquo; She hesitated and
      looked away from him. Then she brought out slowly: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never noticed&mdash;the
      least change&mdash;in&mdash;in my own case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he sounded deprecatingly, and she trembled with the fear of having
      gone too far. But the hour was past when such scruples could restrain her.
      She must know where she was and where Leila was. &ldquo;Mrs. Boulger still cuts
      me,&rdquo; she brought out with an embarrassed laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure? You&rsquo;ve probably cut <i>her</i>; if not now, at least in the
      past. And in a cut if you&rsquo;re not first you&rsquo;re nowhere. That&rsquo;s what keeps
      up so many quarrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word roused Mrs. Lidcote to a renewed sense of realities. &ldquo;But the
      Purshes,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;the Purshes are so strong! There are so many of
      them, and they all back each other up, just as my husband&rsquo;s family did. I
      know what it means to have a clan against one. They&rsquo;re stronger than any
      number of separate friends. The Purshes will <i>never</i> forgive Leila
      for leaving Horace. Why, his mother opposed his marrying her because of&mdash;of
      me. She tried to get Leila to promise that she wouldn&rsquo;t see me when they
      went to Europe on their honeymoon. And now she&rsquo;ll say it was my example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion, vaguely stroking his beard, mused a moment upon this; then
      he asked, with seeming irrelevance, &ldquo;What did Leila say when you wrote
      that you were coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said it wasn&rsquo;t the least necessary, but that I&rsquo;d better come, because
      it was the only way to convince me that it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, that proves she&rsquo;s not afraid of the Purshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She breathed a long sigh of remembrance. &ldquo;Oh, just at first, you know&mdash;one
      never is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on hers with a gesture of intelligence and pity. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      see, you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow lengthened down the deck before them, and a steward stood there,
      proffering a Marconigram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now I shall know!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tore the message open, and then let it fall on her knees, dropping her
      hands on it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ide&rsquo;s enquiry roused her: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite right. Perfectly. She can&rsquo;t come; but she&rsquo;s sending Susy
      Suffern. She says Susy will explain.&rdquo; After another silence she added,
      with a sudden gush of bitterness: &ldquo;As if I needed any explanation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt Ide&rsquo;s hesitating glance upon her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. &lsquo;Prevented last moment. Longing for you, expecting you. Love from
      both.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you <i>see</i>, the poor darling, that she couldn&rsquo;t face it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He waited. &ldquo;Do you mean to go to her immediately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be too late to catch a train this evening; but I shall take the
      first to-morrow morning.&rdquo; She considered a moment. &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s better.
      I need a talk with Susy first. She&rsquo;s to meet me at the dock, and I&rsquo;ll take
      her straight back to the hotel with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she developed this plan, she had the sense that Ide was still
      thoughtfully, even gravely, considering her. When she ceased, he remained
      silent a moment; then he said almost ceremoniously: &ldquo;If your talk with
      Miss Suffern doesn&rsquo;t last too late, may I come and see you when it&rsquo;s over?
      I shall be dining at my club, and I&rsquo;ll call you up at about ten, if I may.
      I&rsquo;m off to Chicago on business to-morrow morning, and it would be a
      satisfaction to know, before I start, that your cousin&rsquo;s been able to
      reassure you, as I know she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a shy deliberateness that, even to Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s troubled
      perceptions, sounded a long-silenced note of feeling. Perhaps the breaking
      down of the barrier of reticence between them had released unsuspected
      emotions in both. The tone of his appeal moved her curiously and loosened
      the tight strain of her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, come&mdash;do come,&rdquo; she said, rising. The huge threat of New
      York was imminent now, dwarfing, under long reaches of embattled masonry,
      the great deck she stood on and all the little specks of life it carried.
      One of them, drifting nearer, took the shape of her maid, followed by
      luggage-laden stewards, and signing to her that it was time to go below.
      As they descended to the main deck, the throng swept her against Mrs.
      Lorin Boulger&rsquo;s shoulder, and she heard the ambassadress call out to some
      one, over the vexed sea of hats: &ldquo;So sorry! I should have been delighted,
      but I&rsquo;ve promised to spend Sunday with some friends at Lenox.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Susy Suffern&rsquo;s explanation did not end till after ten o&rsquo;clock, and she had
      just gone when Franklin Ide, who, complying with an old New York
      tradition, had caused himself to be preceded by a long white box of roses,
      was shown into Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came forward with his shy half-humorous smile and, taking her hand,
      looked at her for a moment without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he then pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote returned his smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary. Everything&rsquo;s
      changed. Even Susy has changed; and you know the extent to which Susy used
      to represent the old New York. There&rsquo;s no old New York left, it seems. She
      talked in the most amazing way. She snaps her fingers at the Purshes. She
      told me&mdash;<i>me</i>, that every woman had a right to happiness and
      that self-expression was the highest duty. She accused me of
      misunderstanding Leila; she said my point of view was conventional! She
      was bursting with pride at having been in the secret, and wearing a brooch
      that Wilbour Barkley&rsquo;d given her!&rdquo; Franklin Ide had seated himself in the
      arm-chair she had pushed forward for him under the electric chandelier. He
      threw back his head and laughed. &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I can&rsquo;t believe that Susy&rsquo;s not mistaken. Poor dear, she has the
      habit of lost causes; and she may feel that, having stuck to me, she can
      do no less than stick to Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;did she?&mdash;openly defy the world for you? She
      didn&rsquo;t snap her fingers at the Lidcotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote shook her head, still smiling. &ldquo;No. It was enough to defy <i>my</i>
      family. It was doubtful at one time if they would tolerate her seeing me,
      and she almost had to disinfect herself after each visit. I believe that
      at first my sister-in-law wouldn&rsquo;t let the girls come down when Susy dined
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t your cousin&rsquo;s present attitude the best possible proof that
      times have changed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know.&rdquo; She leaned forward from her sofa-corner, fixing her
      eyes on his thin kindly face, which gleamed on her indistinctly through
      her tears. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s dazzling. She says Leila&rsquo;s
      perfectly happy. It&rsquo;s as if an angel had gone about lifting gravestones,
      and the buried people walked again, and the living didn&rsquo;t shrink from
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath, and sat looking away from him down the long
      perspective of lamp-fringed streets over which her windows hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand how happy you must be,&rdquo; he began at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him impetuously. &ldquo;Yes, yes; I&rsquo;m happy. But I&rsquo;m lonely, too&mdash;lonelier
      than ever. I didn&rsquo;t take up much room in the world before; but now&mdash;where
      is there a corner for me? Oh. since I&rsquo;ve begun to confess myself, why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I go on? Telling you this lifts a gravestone from <i>me!</i> You
      see, before this, Leila needed me. She was unhappy, and I knew it, and
      though we hardly ever talked of it I felt that, in a way, the thought that
      I&rsquo;d been through the same thing, and down to the dregs of it, helped her.
      And her needing me helped <i>me</i>. And when the news of her marriage
      came my first thought was that now she&rsquo;d need me more than ever, that
      she&rsquo;d have no one but me to turn to. Yes, under all my distress there was
      a fierce joy in that. It was so new and wonderful to feel again that there
      was one person who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get on without me! And now what you
      and Susy tell me seems to have taken my child from me; and just at first
      that&rsquo;s all I can feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all you feel.&rdquo; He looked at her musingly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      Leila come to meet you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was really my fault. You see, I&rsquo;d cabled that I was not sure of
      being able to get off on the <i>Utopia</i>, and apparently my second cable
      was delayed, and when she received it she&rsquo;d already asked some people over
      Sunday&mdash;one or two of her old friends, Susy says. I&rsquo;m so glad they
      should have wanted to go to her at once; but naturally I&rsquo;d rather have
      been alone with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still mean to go, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must. Susy wanted to drag me off to Ridgefield with her over
      Sunday, and Leila sent me word that of course I might go if I wanted to,
      and that I was not to think of her; but I know how disappointed she would
      be. Susy said she was afraid I might be upset at her having people to
      stay, and that, if I minded, she wouldn&rsquo;t urge me to come. But if <i>they</i>
      don&rsquo;t mind, why should I? And of course, if they&rsquo;re willing to go to Leila
      it must mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m glad you recognize that,&rdquo; Franklin Ide exclaimed abruptly.
      He stood up and went over to her, taking her hand with one of his quick
      gestures. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want to say to you,&rdquo; he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The next morning, in the train, through all the other contending thoughts
      in Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s mind there ran the warm undercurrent of what Franklin
      Ide had wanted to say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wanted, she knew, to say it once before, when, nearly eight years
      earlier, the hazard of meeting at the end of a rainy autumn in a deserted
      Swiss hotel had thrown them for a fortnight into unwonted propinquity.
      They had walked and talked together, borrowed each other&rsquo;s books and
      newspapers, spent the long chill evenings over the fire in the dim
      lamplight of her little pitch-pine sitting-room; and she had been
      wonderfully comforted by his presence, and hard frozen places in her had
      melted, and she had known that she would be desperately sorry when he
      went. And then, just at the end, in his odd indirect way, he had let her
      see that it rested with her to have him stay. She could still relive the
      sleepless night she had given to that discovery. It was preposterous, of
      course, to think of repaying his devotion by accepting such a sacrifice;
      but how find reasons to convince him? She could not bear to let him think
      her less touched, less inclined to him than she was: the generosity of his
      love deserved that she should repay it with the truth. Yet how let him see
      what she felt, and yet refuse what he offered? How confess to him what had
      been on her lips when he made the offer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen what it did to one
      man; and there must never, never be another&rdquo;? The tacit ignoring of her
      past had been the element in which their friendship lived, and she could
      not suddenly, to him of all men, begin to talk of herself like a guilty
      woman in a play. Somehow, in the end, she had managed it, had averted a
      direct explanation, had made him understand that her life was over, that
      she existed only for her daughter, and that a more definite word from him
      would have been almost a breach of delicacy. She was so used to be having
      as if her life were over! And, at any rate, he had taken her hint, and she
      had been able to spare her sensitiveness and his. The next year, when he
      came to Florence to see her, they met again in the old friendly way; and
      that till now had continued to be the tenor of their intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, suddenly and unexpectedly, he had brought up the question again,
      directly this time, and in such a form that she could not evade it:
      putting the renewal of his plea, after so long an interval, on the ground
      that, on her own showing, her chief argument against it no longer existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me Leila&rsquo;s happy. If she&rsquo;s happy, she doesn&rsquo;t need you&mdash;need
      you, that is, in the same way as before. You wanted, I know, to be always
      in reach, always free and available if she should suddenly call you to her
      or take refuge with you. I understood that&mdash;I respected it. I didn&rsquo;t
      urge my case because I saw it was useless. You couldn&rsquo;t, I understood well
      enough, have felt free to take such happiness as life with me might give
      you while she was unhappy, and, as you imagined, with no hope of release.
      Even then I didn&rsquo;t feel as you did about it; I understood better the trend
      of things here. But ten years ago the change hadn&rsquo;t really come; and I had
      no way of convincing you that it was coming. Still, I always fancied that
      Leila might not think her case was closed, and so I chose to think that
      ours wasn&rsquo;t either. Let me go on thinking so, at any rate, till you&rsquo;ve
      seen her, and confirmed with your own eyes what Susy Suffern tells you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      All through what Susy Suffern told and retold her during their four-hours&rsquo; 
      flight to the hills this plea of Ide&rsquo;s kept coming back to Mrs. Lidcote.
      She did not yet know what she felt as to its bearing on her own fate, but
      it was something on which her confused thoughts could stay themselves amid
      the welter of new impressions, and she was inexpressibly glad that he had
      said what he had, and said it at that particular moment. It helped her to
      hold fast to her identity in the rush of strange names and new categories
      that her cousin&rsquo;s talk poured out on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the progress of the journey Miss Suffern&rsquo;s communications grew more
      and more amazing. She was like a cicerone preparing the mind of an
      inexperienced traveller for the marvels about to burst on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t know Leila. She&rsquo;s had her pearls reset. Sargent&rsquo;s to paint her.
      Oh, and I was to tell you that she hopes you won&rsquo;t mind being the least
      bit squeezed over Sunday. The house was built by Wilbour&rsquo;s father, you
      know, and it&rsquo;s rather old-fashioned&mdash;only ten spare bedrooms. Of
      course that&rsquo;s small for what they mean to do, and she&rsquo;ll show you the new
      plans they&rsquo;ve had made. Their idea is to keep the present house as a wing.
      She told me to explain&mdash;she&rsquo;s so dreadfully sorry not to be able to
      give you a sitting-room just at first. They&rsquo;re thinking of Egypt for next
      winter, unless, of course, Wilbour gets his appointment. Oh, didn&rsquo;t she
      write you about that? Why, he wants Borne, you know&mdash;the second
      secretaryship. Or, rather, he wanted England; but Leila insisted that if
      they went abroad she must be near you. And of course what she says is law.
      Oh, they quite hope they&rsquo;ll get it. You see Horace&rsquo;s uncle is in the
      Cabinet,&mdash;one of the assistant secretaries,&mdash;and I believe he
      has a good deal of pull&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace&rsquo;s uncle? You mean Wilbour&rsquo;s, I suppose,&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote interjected,
      with a gasp of which a fraction was given to Miss Suffern&rsquo;s flippant use
      of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilbour&rsquo;s? No, I don&rsquo;t. I mean Horace&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s no bad feeling between
      them, I assure you. Since Horace&rsquo;s engagement was announced&mdash;you
      didn&rsquo;t know Horace was engaged? Why, he&rsquo;s marrying one of Bishop
      Thorbury&rsquo;s girls: the red-haired one who wrote the novel that every one&rsquo;s
      talking about, &lsquo;This Flesh of Mine.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re to be married in the
      cathedral. Of course Horace <i>can</i>, because it was Leila who&mdash;but,
      as I say, there&rsquo;s not the <i>least</i> feeling, and Horace wrote himself
      to his uncle about Wilbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote&rsquo;s thoughts fled back to what she had said to Ide the day
      before on the deck of the <i>Utopia</i>. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take up much room
      before, but now where is there a corner for me?&rdquo; Where indeed in this
      crowded, topsy-turvey world, with its headlong changes and helter-skelter
      readjustments, its new tolerances and indifferences and accommodations,
      was there room for a character fashioned by slower sterner processes and a
      life broken under their inexorable pressure? And then, in a flash, she
      viewed the chaos from a new angle, and order seemed to move upon the void.
      If the old processes were changed, her case was changed with them; she,
      too, was a part of the general readjustment, a tiny fragment of the new
      pattern worked out in bolder freer harmonies. Since her daughter had no
      penalty to pay, was not she herself released by the same stroke? The rich
      arrears of youth and joy were gone; but was there not time enough left to
      accumulate new stores of happiness? That, of course, was what Franklin Ide
      had felt and had meant her to feel. He had seen at once what the change in
      her daughter&rsquo;s situation would make in her view of her own. It was almost&mdash;wondrously
      enough!&mdash;as if Leila&rsquo;s folly had been the means of vindicating hers.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Everything else for the moment faded for Mrs. Lidcote in the glow of her
      daughter&rsquo;s embrace. It was unnatural, it was almost terrifying, to find
      herself standing on a strange threshold, under an unknown roof, in a big
      hall full of pictures, flowers, firelight, and hurrying servants, and in
      this spacious unfamiliar confusion to discover Leila, bareheaded,
      laughing, authoritative, with a strange young man jovially echoing her
      welcome and transmitting her orders; but once Mrs. Lidcote had her child
      on her breast, and her child&rsquo;s &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, you old darling!&rdquo; in her
      ears, every other feeling was lost in the deep sense of well-being that
      only Leila&rsquo;s hug could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense was still with her, warming her veins and pleasantly fluttering
      her heart, as she went up to her room after luncheon. A little constrained
      by the presence of visitors, and not altogether sorry to defer for a few
      hours the &ldquo;long talk&rdquo; with her daughter for which she somehow felt herself
      tremulously unready, she had withdrawn, on the plea of fatigue, to the
      bright luxurious bedroom into which Leila had again and again apologized
      for having been obliged to squeeze her. The room was bigger and finer than
      any in her small apartment in Florence; but it was not the standard of
      affluence implied in her daughter&rsquo;s tone about it that chiefly struck her,
      nor yet the finish and complexity of its appointments. It was the look it
      shared with the rest of the house, and with the perspective of the gardens
      beneath its windows, of being part of an &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;&mdash;of
      something solid, avowed, founded on sacraments and precedents and
      principles. There was nothing about the place, or about Leila and Wilbour,
      that suggested either passion or peril: their relation seemed as
      comfortable as their furniture and as respectable as their balance at the
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, in the whole confusing experience, the thing that confused Mrs.
      Lidcote most, that gave her at once the deepest feeling of security for
      Leila and the strongest sense of apprehension for herself. Yes, there was
      something oppressive in the completeness and compactness of Leila&rsquo;s
      well-being. Ide had been right: her daughter did not need her. Leila, with
      her first embrace, had unconsciously attested the fact in the same phrase
      as Ide himself and as the two young women with the hats. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,
      you old darling!&rdquo; she had said; and her mother sat alone, trying to fit
      herself into the new scheme of things which such a certainty betokened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first distinct feeling was one of irrational resentment. If such a
      change was to come, why had it not come sooner? Here was she, a woman not
      yet old, who had paid with the best years of her life for the theft of the
      happiness that her daughter&rsquo;s contemporaries were taking as their due.
      There was no sense, no sequence, in it. She had had what she wanted, but
      she had had to pay too much for it. She had had to pay the last bitterest
      price of learning that love has a price: that it is worth so much and no
      more. She had known the anguish of watching the man she loved discover
      this first, and of reading the discovery in his eyes. It was a part of her
      history that she had not trusted herself to think of for a long time past:
      she always took a big turn about that haunted corner. But now, at the
      sight of the young man downstairs, so openly and jovially Leila&rsquo;s, she was
      overwhelmed at the senseless waste of her own adventure, and wrung with
      the irony of perceiving that the success or failure of the deepest human
      experiences may hang on a matter of chronology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then gradually the thought of Ide returned to her. &ldquo;I chose to think that
      our case wasn&rsquo;t closed,&rdquo; he had said. She had been deeply touched by that.
      To every one else her case had been closed so long! <i>Finis</i> was
      scrawled all over her. But here was one man who had believed and waited,
      and what if what he believed in and waited for were coming true? If
      Leila&rsquo;s &ldquo;all right&rdquo; should really foreshadow hers?
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet, of course, it was impossible to tell. She had fancied, indeed,
      when she entered the drawing-room before luncheon, that a too-sudden hush
      had fallen on the assembled group of Leila&rsquo;s friends, on the slender
      vociferous young women and the lounging golf-stockinged young men. They
      had all received her politely, with the kind of petrified politeness that
      may be either a tribute to age or a protest at laxity; but to them, of
      course, she must be an old woman because she was Leila&rsquo;s mother, and in a
      society so dominated by youth the mere presence of maturity was a
      constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the young girls, however, had presently emerged from the group,
      and, attaching herself to Mrs. Lidcote, had listened to her with a blue
      gaze of admiration which gave the older woman a sudden happy consciousness
      of her long-forgotten social graces. It was agreeable to find herself
      attracting this young Charlotte Wynn, whose mother had been among her
      closest friends, and in whom something of the soberness and softness of
      the earlier manners had survived. But the little colloquy, broken up by
      the announcement of luncheon, could of course result in nothing more
      definite than this reminiscent emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she could not yet tell how her own case was to be fitted into the new
      order of things; but there were more people&mdash;&ldquo;older people&rdquo; Leila had
      put it&mdash;arriving by the afternoon train, and that evening at dinner
      she would doubtless be able to judge. She began to wonder nervously who
      the new-comers might be. Probably she would be spared the embarrassment of
      finding old acquaintances among them; but it was odd that her daughter had
      mentioned no names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila had proposed that, later in the afternoon, Wilbour should take her
      mother for a drive: she said she wanted them to have a &ldquo;nice, quiet talk.&rdquo;
       But Mrs. Lidcote wished her talk with Leila to come first, and had,
      moreover, at luncheon, caught stray allusions to an impending tennis-match
      in which her son-in-law was engaged. Her fatigue had been a sufficient
      pretext for declining the drive, and she had begged Leila to think of her
      as peacefully resting in her room till such time as they could snatch
      their quiet moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before tea, then, you duck!&rdquo; Leila with a last kiss had decided; and
      presently Mrs. Lidcote, through her open window, had heard the fresh loud
      voices of her daughter&rsquo;s visitors chiming across the gardens from the
      tennis-court.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leila had come and gone, and they had had their talk. It had not lasted as
      long as Mrs. Lidcote wished, for in the middle of it Leila had been
      summoned to the telephone to receive an important message from town, and
      had sent word to her mother that she couldn&rsquo;t come back just then, as one
      of the young ladies had been called away unexpectedly and arrangements had
      to be made for her departure. But the mother and daughter had had almost
      an hour together, and Mrs. Lidcote was happy. She had never seen Leila so
      tender, so solicitous. The only thing that troubled her was the very
      excess of this solicitude, the exaggerated expression of her daughter&rsquo;s
      annoyance that their first moments together should have been marred by the
      presence of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not strangers to me, darling, since they&rsquo;re friends of yours,&rdquo; her mother
      had assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I know your feeling, you queer wild mother. I know how you&rsquo;ve
      always hated people.&rdquo; (<i>Hated people!</i> Had Leila forgotten why?) &ldquo;And
      that&rsquo;s why I told Susy that if you preferred to go with her to Ridgefield
      on Sunday I should perfectly understand, and patiently wait for our good
      hug. But you didn&rsquo;t really mind them at luncheon, did you, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote, at that, had suddenly thrown a startled look at her
      daughter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind things of that kind any longer,&rdquo; she had simply
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t console me for having exposed you to the bother of it,
      for having let you come here when I ought to have <i>ordered</i> you off
      to Ridgefield with Susy. If Susy hadn&rsquo;t been stupid she&rsquo;d have made you go
      there with her. I hate to think of you up here all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Lidcote tried to read something more than a rather obtuse
      devotion in her daughter&rsquo;s radiant gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have had a rest this
      afternoon, dear; and later&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, later, when all this fuss is over, we&rsquo;ll more than make up for
      it, sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we, you precious darling?&rdquo; And at this point Leila had been
      summoned to the telephone, leaving Mrs. Lidcote to her conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were still floating before her in cloudy uncertainty when Miss
      Suffern tapped at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to take me down to tea? I&rsquo;d forgotten how late it was,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Lidcote exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern, a plump peering little woman, with prim hair and a
      conciliatory smile, nervously adjusted the pendent bugles of her elaborate
      black dress. Miss Suffern was always in mourning, and always commemorating
      the demise of distant relatives by wearing the discarded wardrobe of their
      next of kin. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>exactly</i> mourning,&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
      the only stitch of black poor Julia had&mdash;and of course George was
      only my mother&rsquo;s step-cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she came forward Mrs. Lidcote found herself humorously wondering
      whether she were mourning Horace Pursh&rsquo;s divorce in one of his mother&rsquo;s
      old black satins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>did</i> you mean to go down for tea?&rdquo; Susy Suffern peered at her,
      a little fluttered. &ldquo;Leila sent me up to keep you company. She thought it
      would be cozier for you to stay here. She was afraid you were feeling
      rather tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was; but I&rsquo;ve had the whole afternoon to rest in. And this wonderful
      sofa to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila told me to tell you that she&rsquo;d rush up for a minute before dinner,
      after everybody had arrived; but the train is always dreadfully late.
      She&rsquo;s in despair at not giving you a sitting-room; she wanted to know if I
      thought you really minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s not like Leila to think I should.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Lidcote drew aside to make way for the housemaid, who appeared in the
      doorway bearing a table spread with a bewildering variety of tea-cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila saw to it herself,&rdquo; Miss Suffern murmured as the door closed. &ldquo;Her
      one idea is that you should feel happy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck Mrs. Lidcote as one more mark of the subverted state of things
      that her daughter&rsquo;s solicitude should find expression in the multiplicity
      of sandwiches and the piping-hotness of muffins; but then everything that
      had happened since her arrival seemed to increase her confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of a motor-horn down the drive gave another turn to her thoughts.
      &ldquo;Are those the new arrivals already?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no; they won&rsquo;t be here till after seven.&rdquo; Miss Suffern craned
      her head from the window to catch a glimpse of the motor. &ldquo;It must be
      Charlotte leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it the little Wynn girl who was called away in a hurry? I hope it&rsquo;s
      not on account of illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I believe there was some mistake about dates. Her mother
      telephoned her that she was expected at the Stepleys, at Fishkill, and she
      had to be rushed over to Albany to catch a train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote meditated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. She&rsquo;s a charming young thing. I hoped
      I should have another talk with her this evening after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo; Miss Suffern&rsquo;s gaze grew vague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>do</i> look tired, you know,&rdquo; she continued, seating herself at
      the tea-table and preparing to dispense its delicacies. &ldquo;You must go
      straight back to your sofa and let me wait on you. The excitement has told
      on you more than you think, and you mustn&rsquo;t fight against it any longer.
      Just stay quietly up here and let yourself go. You&rsquo;ll have Leila to
      yourself on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote received the tea-cup which her cousin proffered, but showed
      no other disposition to obey her injunctions. For a moment she stirred her
      tea in silence; then she asked: &ldquo;Is it your idea that I should stay
      quietly up here till Monday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern set down her cup with a gesture so sudden that it endangered
      an adjacent plate of scones. When she had assured herself of the safety of
      the scones she looked up with a fluttered laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps, dear, by
      to-morrow you&rsquo;ll be feeling differently. The air here, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote bent forward to help herself to a scone.
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s arriving this evening?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern frowned and peered. &ldquo;You know my wretched head for names.
      Leila told me&mdash;but there are so many&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many? She didn&rsquo;t tell me she expected a big party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not big: but rather outside of her little group. And of course, as
      it&rsquo;s the first time, she&rsquo;s a little excited at having the older set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The older set? Our contemporaries, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes.&rdquo; Miss Suffern paused as if to gather herself up for a
      leap. &ldquo;The Ashton Gileses,&rdquo; she brought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ashton Gileses? Really? I shall be glad to see Mary Giles again. It
      must be eighteen years,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lidcote steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss Suffern gasped, precipitately refilling her cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ashton Gileses; and who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the Sam Fresbies. But the most important person, of course, is Mrs.
      Lorin Boulger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Boulger? Leila didn&rsquo;t tell me she was coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she? I suppose she forgot everything when she saw you. But the
      party was got up for Mrs. Boulger. You see, it&rsquo;s very important that she
      should&mdash;well, take a fancy to Leila and Wilbour; his being appointed
      to Rome virtually depends on it. And you know Leila insists on Rome in
      order to be near you. So she asked Mary Giles, who&rsquo;s intimate with the
      Boulgers, if the visit couldn&rsquo;t possibly be arranged; and Mary&rsquo;s cable
      caught Mrs. Boulger at Cherbourg. She&rsquo;s to be only a fortnight in America;
      and getting her to come directly here was rather a triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I see it was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lidcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, she&rsquo;s rather&mdash;rather fussy; and Mary was a little doubtful
      if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she would, on account of Leila?&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. In her official position. But luckily she&rsquo;s a friend of the
      Barkleys. And finding the Gileses and Fresbies here will make it all
      right. The times have changed!&rdquo; Susy Suffern indulgently summed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote smiled. &ldquo;Yes; a few years ago it would have seemed improbable
      that I should ever again be dining with Mary Giles and Harriet Fresbie and
      Mrs. Lorin Boulger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern did not at the moment seem disposed to enlarge upon this
      theme; and after an interval of silence Mrs. Lidcote suddenly resumed: &ldquo;Do
      they know I&rsquo;m here, by the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of her question was to produce in Miss Suffern an exaggerated
      access of peering and frowning. She twitched the tea-things about,
      fingered her bugles, and, looking at the clock, exclaimed amazedly:
      &ldquo;Mercy! Is it seven already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that it can make any difference, I suppose,&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote continued.
      &ldquo;But did Leila tell them I was coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern looked at her with pain. &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t suppose, dearest,
      that Leila would do anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote went on: &ldquo;For, of course, it&rsquo;s of the first importance, as
      you say, that Mrs. Lorin Boulger should be favorably impressed, in order
      that Wilbour may have the best possible chance of getting Borne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>told</i> Leila you&rsquo;d feel that, dear. You see, it&rsquo;s actually on <i>your</i>
      account&mdash;so that they may get a post near you&mdash;that Leila invited
      Mrs. Boulger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see that.&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote, abruptly rising from her seat, turned her
      eyes to the clock. &ldquo;But, as you say, it&rsquo;s getting late. Oughtn&rsquo;t we to
      dress for dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern, at the suggestion, stood up also, an agitated hand among her
      bugles. &ldquo;I do wish I could persuade you to stay up here this evening. I&rsquo;m
      sure Leila&rsquo;d be happier if you would. Really, you&rsquo;re much too tired to
      come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense, Susy!&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote spoke with a sudden sharpness, her
      hand stretched to the bell. &ldquo;When do we dine? At half-past eight? Then I
      must really send you packing. At my age it takes time to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern, thus projected toward the threshold, lingered there to
      repeat: &ldquo;Leila&rsquo;ll never forgive herself if you make an effort you&rsquo;re not
      up to.&rdquo; But Mrs. Lidcote smiled on her without answering, and the icy
      lightwave propelled her through the door.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote, though she had made the gesture of ringing for her maid, had
      not done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed, she continued to stand motionless in the middle of
      her soft spacious room. The fire which had been kindled at twilight danced
      on the brightness of silver and mirrors and sober gilding; and the sofa
      toward which she had been urged by Miss Suffern heaped up its cushions in
      inviting proximity to a table laden with new books and papers. She could
      not recall having ever been more luxuriously housed, or having ever had so
      strange a sense of being out alone, under the night, in a windbeaten
      plain. She sat down by the fire and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock on the door made her lift her head, and she saw her daughter on
      the threshold. The intricate ordering of Leila&rsquo;s fair hair and the flying
      folds of her dressinggown showed that she had interrupted her dressing to
      hasten to her mother; but once in the room she paused a moment, smiling
      uncertainly, as though she had forgotten the object of her haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote rose to her feet. &ldquo;Time to dress, dearest? Don&rsquo;t scold! I
      shan&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To dress?&rdquo; Leila stood before her with a puzzled look. &ldquo;Why, I thought,
      dear&mdash;I mean, I hoped you&rsquo;d decided just to stay here quietly and
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother smiled. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been resting all the afternoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;you know you <i>do</i> look tired. And when Susy told me
      just now that you meant to make the effort&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to stop me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you that you needn&rsquo;t feel in the least obliged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause during which Leila, vaguely averting herself from her
      mother&rsquo;s scrutiny, drifted toward the dressing-table and began to disturb
      the symmetry of the brushes and bottles laid out on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your visitors know that I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; Mrs. Lidcote suddenly went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they&mdash;Of course&mdash;why, naturally,&rdquo; Leila rejoined, absorbed
      in trying to turn the stopper of a salts-bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then won&rsquo;t they think it odd if I don&rsquo;t appear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not in the least, dearest. I assure you they&rsquo;ll <i>all</i>
      understand.&rdquo; Leila laid down the bottle and turned back to her mother, her
      face alight with reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote stood motionless, her head erect, her smiling eyes on her
      daughter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Will they think it odd if I <i>do</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila stopped short, her lips half parted to reply. As she paused, the
      colour stole over her bare neck, swept up to her throat, and burst into
      flame in her cheeks. Thence it sent its devastating crimson up to her very
      temples, to the lobes of her ears, to the edges of her eyelids, beating
      all over her in fiery waves, as if fanned by some imperceptible wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote silently watched the conflagration; then she turned away her
      eyes with a slight laugh. &ldquo;I only meant that I was afraid it might upset
      the arrangement of your dinner-table if I didn&rsquo;t come down. If you can
      assure me that it won&rsquo;t, I believe I&rsquo;ll take you at your word and go back
      to this irresistible sofa.&rdquo; She paused, as if waiting for her daughter to
      speak; then she held out her arms. &ldquo;Run off and dress, dearest; and don&rsquo;t
      have me on your mind.&rdquo; She clasped Leila close, pressing a long kiss on
      the last afterglow of her subsiding blush. &ldquo;I do feel the least bit
      overdone, and if it won&rsquo;t inconvenience you to have me drop out of things,
      I believe I&rsquo;ll basely take to my bed and stay there till your party
      scatters. And now run off, or you&rsquo;ll be late; and make my excuses to them
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Barkleys&rsquo; visitors had dispersed, and Mrs. Lidcote, completely
      restored by her two days&rsquo; rest, found herself, on the following Monday
      alone with her children and Miss Suffern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of jubilation in the air, for the party had &ldquo;gone off&rdquo; so
      extraordinarily well, and so completely, as it appeared, to the
      satisfaction of Mrs. Lorin Boulger, that Wilbour&rsquo;s early appointment to
      Rome was almost to be counted on. So certain did this seem that the
      prospect of a prompt reunion mitigated the distress with which Leila
      learned of her mother&rsquo;s decision to return almost immediately to Italy. No
      one understood this decision; it seemed to Leila absolutely unintelligible
      that Mrs. Lidcote should not stay on with them till their own fate was
      fixed, and Wilbour echoed her astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you, as Leila says, wait here till we can all pack up and
      go together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote smiled her gratitude with her refusal. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s not
      yet sure that you&rsquo;ll be packing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you ought to have seen Wilbour with Mrs. Boulger,&rdquo; Leila triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ought to have seen Leila with her,&rdquo; Leila&rsquo;s husband exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Suffern enthusiastically appended: &ldquo;I <i>do</i> think inviting
      Harriet Fresbie was a stroke of genius!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be with you soon,&rdquo; Leila laughed. &ldquo;So soon that it&rsquo;s really
      foolish to separate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Lidcote held out with the quiet firmness which her daughter knew
      it was useless to oppose. After her long months in India, it was really
      imperative, she declared, that she should get back to Florence and see
      what was happening to her little place there; and she had been so
      comfortable on the <i>Utopia</i> that she had a fancy to return by the
      same ship. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to acquiesce in her
      decision and keep her with them till the afternoon before the day of the
      <i>Utopia&rsquo;s</i> sailing. This arrangement fitted in with certain projects
      which, during her two days&rsquo; seclusion, Mrs. Lidcote had silently matured.
      It had become to her of the first importance to get away as soon as she
      could, and the little place in Florence, which held her past in every fold
      of its curtains and between every page of its books, seemed now to her the
      one spot where that past would be endurable to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not unhappy during the intervening days. The sight of Leila&rsquo;s
      well-being, the sense of Leila&rsquo;s tenderness, were, after all, what she had
      come for; and of these she had had full measure. Leila had never been
      happier or more tender; and the contemplation of her bliss, and the
      enjoyment of her affection, were an absorbing occupation for her mother.
      But they were also a sharp strain on certain overtightened chords, and
      Mrs. Lidcote, when at last she found herself alone in the New York hotel
      to which she had returned the night before embarking, had the feeling that
      she had just escaped with her life from the clutch of a giant hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had refused to let her daughter come to town with her; she had even
      rejected Susy Suffern&rsquo;s company. She wanted no viaticum but that of her
      own thoughts; and she let these come to her without shrinking from them as
      she sat in the same high-hung sitting-room in which, just a week before,
      she and Franklin Ide had had their memorable talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had promised her friend to let him hear from her, but she had not kept
      her promise. She knew that he had probably come back from Chicago, and
      that if he learned of her sudden decision to return to Italy it would be
      impossible for her not to see him before sailing; and as she wished above
      all things not to see him she had kept silent, intending to send him a
      letter from the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason why she should wait till then to write it. The actual
      moment was more favorable, and the task, though not agreeable, would at
      least bridge over an hour of her lonely evening. She went up to the
      writing-table, drew out a sheet of paper and began to write his name. And
      as she did so, the door opened and he came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words she met him with were the last she could have imagined herself
      saying when they had parted. &ldquo;How in the world did you know that I was
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her meaning in a flash. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want me to, then?&rdquo; He stood
      looking at her. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to have taken your silence as meaning
      that. But I happened to meet Mrs. Wynn, who is stopping here, and she
      asked me to dine with her and Charlotte, and Charlotte&rsquo;s young man. They
      told me they&rsquo;d seen you arriving this afternoon, and I couldn&rsquo;t help
      coming up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause between them, which Mrs. Lidcote at last surprisingly
      broke with the exclamation: &ldquo;Ah, she <i>did</i> recognize me, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recognize you?&rdquo; He stared. &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I saw she did, though she never moved an eyelid. I saw it by
      Charlotte&rsquo;s blush. The child has the prettiest blush. I saw that her
      mother wouldn&rsquo;t let her speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide put down his hat with an impatient laugh. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Leila cured you of
      your delusions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him intently. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think Margaret Wynn meant to
      cut me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your ideas are absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a perceptible moment without taking this up; then she said,
      at a tangent: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sailing tomorrow early. I meant to write to you&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      the letter I&rsquo;d begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide followed her gesture, and then turned his eyes back to her face. &ldquo;You
      didn&rsquo;t mean to see me, then, or even to let me know that you were going
      till you&rsquo;d left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt it would be easier to explain to you in a letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in God&rsquo;s name is there to explain?&rdquo; She made no reply, and he
      pressed on: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that you&rsquo;re worried about Leila, for Charlotte
      Wynn told me she&rsquo;d been there last week, and there was a big party
      arriving when she left: Fresbies and Gileses, and Mrs. Lorin Boulger&mdash;all
      the board of examiners! If Leila has passed <i>that</i>, she&rsquo;s got her
      degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote had dropped down into a corner of the sofa where she had sat
      during their talk of the week before. &ldquo;I was stupid,&rdquo; she began abruptly.
      &ldquo;I ought to have gone to Ridgefield with Susy. I didn&rsquo;t see till afterward
      that I was expected to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were expected to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t Leila&rsquo;s fault. She suffered&mdash;poor darling; she
      was distracted. But she&rsquo;d asked her party before she knew I was arriving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to that&mdash;&rdquo; Ide drew a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;I can
      understand that it must have been a disappointment not to have you to
      herself just at first. But, after all, you were among old friends or their
      children: the Gileses and Fresbies&mdash;and little Charlotte Wynn.&rdquo; He
      paused a moment before the last name, and scrutinized her hesitatingly.
      &ldquo;Even if they came at the wrong time, you must have been glad to see them
      all at Leila&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him back his look with a faint smile. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is, excepting little Charlotte Wynn. That child is exquisite. We
      had a talk before luncheon the day I arrived. But when her mother found
      out that I was staying in the house she telephoned her to leave
      immediately, and so I didn&rsquo;t see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour rushed to Ide&rsquo;s sallow face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you get such
      ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pursued, as if she had not heard him: &ldquo;Oh, and I saw Mary Giles for a
      minute too. Susy Suffern brought her up to my room the last evening, after
      dinner, when all the others were at bridge. She meant it kindly&mdash;but
      it wasn&rsquo;t much use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what were you doing in your room in the evening after dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, when I found out my mistake in coming,&mdash;how
      embarrassing it was for Leila, I mean&mdash;I simply told her I was very
      tired, and preferred to stay upstairs till the party was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide, with a groan, struck his hand against the arm of his chair. &ldquo;I wonder
      how much of all this you simply imagined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t imagine the fact of Harriet Fresbie&rsquo;s not even asking if she
      might see me when she knew I was in the house. Nor of Mary Giles&rsquo;s getting
      Susy, at the eleventh hour, to smuggle her up to my room when the others
      wouldn&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;d gone; nor poor Leila&rsquo;s ghastly fear lest Mrs.
      Lorin Boulger, for whom the party was given, should guess I was in the
      house, and prevent her husband&rsquo;s giving Wilbour the second secretaryship
      because she&rsquo;d been obliged to spend a night under the same roof with his
      mother-in-law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide continued to drum on his chair-arm with exasperated fingers. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> that any of the acts you describe are due to the causes
      you suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lidcote paused before replying, as if honestly trying to measure the
      weight of this argument. Then she said in a low tone: &ldquo;I know that Leila
      was in an agony lest I should come down to dinner the first night. And it
      was for me she was afraid, not for herself. Leila is never afraid for
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the conclusions you draw are simply preposterous. There are
      narrow-minded women everywhere, but the women who were at Leila&rsquo;s knew
      perfectly well that their going there would give her a sort of social
      sanction, and if they were willing that she should have it, why on earth
      should they want to withhold it from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told myself a week ago, in this very room, after my first
      talk with Susy Suffern.&rdquo; She lifted a misty smile to his anxious eyes.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I listened to what you said to me the same evening, and why
      your arguments half convinced me, and made me think that what had been
      possible for Leila might not be impossible for me. If the new dispensation
      had come, why not for me as well as for the others? I can&rsquo;t tell you the
      flight my imagination took!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franklin Ide rose from his seat and crossed the room to a chair near her
      sofa-corner. &ldquo;All I cared about was that it seemed&mdash;for the moment&mdash;to
      be carrying you toward me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cared about that, too. That&rsquo;s why I meant to go away without seeing
      you.&rdquo; They gave each other grave look for look. &ldquo;Because, you see, I was
      mistaken,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;We were both mistaken. You say it&rsquo;s preposterous
      that the women who didn&rsquo;t object to accepting Leila&rsquo;s hospitality should
      have objected to meeting me under her roof. And so it is; but I begin to
      understand why. It&rsquo;s simply that society is much too busy to revise its
      own judgments. Probably no one in the house with me stopped to consider
      that my case and Leila&rsquo;s were identical. They only remembered that I&rsquo;d
      done something which, at the time I did it, was condemned by society. My
      case has been passed on and classified: I&rsquo;m the woman who has been cut for
      nearly twenty years. The older people have half forgotten why, and the
      younger ones have never really known: it&rsquo;s simply become a tradition to
      cut me. And traditions that have lost their meaning are the hardest of all
      to destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide sat motionless while she spoke. As she ended, he stood up with a short
      laugh and walked across the room to the window. Outside, the immense black
      prospect of New York, strung with its myriad lines of light, stretched
      away into the smoky edges of the night. He showed it to her with a
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose such words as you&rsquo;ve been using&mdash;&lsquo;society,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;tradition,&rsquo; and the rest&mdash;mean to all the life out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came and stood by him in the window. &ldquo;Less than nothing, of course.
      But you and I are not out there. We&rsquo;re shut up in a little tight round of
      habit and association, just as we&rsquo;re shut up in this room. Remember, I
      thought I&rsquo;d got out of it once; but what really happened was that the
      other people went out, and left me in the same little room. The only
      difference was that I was there alone. Oh, I&rsquo;ve made it habitable now, I&rsquo;m
      used to it; but I&rsquo;ve lost any illusions I may have had as to an angel&rsquo;s
      opening the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide again laughed impatiently. &ldquo;Well, if the door won&rsquo;t open, why not let
      another prisoner in? At least it would be less of a solitude&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the dark window back into the vividly lighted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be more of a prison. You forget that I know all about that.
      We&rsquo;re all imprisoned, of course&mdash;all of us middling people, who don&rsquo;t
      carry our freedom in our brains. But we&rsquo;ve accommodated ourselves to our
      different cells, and if we&rsquo;re moved suddenly into new ones we&rsquo;re likely to
      find a stone wall where we thought there was thin air, and to knock
      ourselves senseless against it. I saw a man do that once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ide, leaning with folded arms against the windowframe, watched her in
      silence as she moved restlessly about the room, gathering together some
      scattered books and tossing a handful of torn letters into the
      paperbasket. When she ceased, he rejoined: &ldquo;All you say is based on
      preconceived theories. Why didn&rsquo;t you put them to the test by coming down
      to meet your old friends? Don&rsquo;t you see the inference they would naturally
      draw from your hiding yourself when they arrived? It looked as though you
      were afraid of them&mdash;or as though you hadn&rsquo;t forgiven them. Either
      way, you put them in the wrong instead of waiting to let them put you in
      the right. If Leila had buried herself in a desert do you suppose society
      would have gone to fetch her out? You say you were afraid for Leila and
      that she was afraid for you. Don&rsquo;t you see what all these complications of
      feeling mean? Simply that you were too nervous at the moment to let things
      happen naturally, just as you&rsquo;re too nervous now to judge them
      rationally.&rdquo; He paused and turned his eyes to her face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to just
      yet. Give yourself a little more time. Give <i>me</i> a little more time.
      I&rsquo;ve always known it would take time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved nearer, and she let him have her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the grave kindness of his face so close above her she felt like a
      child roused out of frightened dreams and finding a light in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right&mdash;&rdquo; she heard herself begin; then something
      within her clutched her back, and her hand fell away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m right: trust me,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk of this in Florence
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him, feeling with despair his kindness, his patience and
      his unreality. Everything he said seemed like a painted gauze let down
      between herself and the real facts of life; and a sudden desire seized her
      to tear the gauze into shreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back and looked at him with a smile of superficial reassurance.
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> right&mdash;about not talking any longer now. I&rsquo;m nervous
      and tired, and it would do no good. I brood over things too much. As you
      say, I must try not to shrink from people.&rdquo; She turned away and glanced at
      the clock. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only ten! If I send you off I shall begin to brood
      again; and if you stay we shall go on talking about the same thing. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t we go down and see Margaret Wynn for half an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke lightly and rapidly, her brilliant eyes on his face. As she
      watched him, she saw it change, as if her smile had thrown a too vivid
      light upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;not to-night!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night? Why, what other night have I, when I&rsquo;m off at dawn?
      Besides, I want to show you at once that I mean to be more sensible&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;m not going to be afraid of people any more. And I should really like
      another glimpse of little Charlotte.&rdquo; He stood before her, his hand in his
      beard, with the gesture he had in moments of perplexity. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she
      ordered him gaily, turning to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her and laid his hand on her arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
      you better let me go first and see? They told me they&rsquo;d had a tiring day
      at the dressmaker&rsquo;s* I daresay they have gone to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said they&rsquo;d a young man of Charlotte&rsquo;s dining with them. Surely
      he wouldn&rsquo;t have left by ten? At any rate, I&rsquo;ll go down with you and see.
      It takes so long if one sends a servant first&rdquo; She put him gently aside,
      and then paused as a new thought struck her. &ldquo;Or wait; my maid&rsquo;s in the
      next room. I&rsquo;ll tell her to go and ask if Margaret will receive me. Yes,
      that&rsquo;s much the best way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned back and went toward the door that led to her bedroom; but
      before she could open it she felt Ide&rsquo;s quick touch again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe&mdash;I remember now&mdash;Charlotte&rsquo;s young man was suggesting
      that they should all go out&mdash;to a musichall or something of the sort.
      I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;I&rsquo;m positively sure that you won&rsquo;t find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand dropped from the door, his dropped from her arm, and as they drew
      back and faced each other she saw the blood rise slowly through his sallow
      skin, redden his neck and ears, encroach upon the edges of his beard, and
      settle in dull patches under his kind troubled eyes. She had seen the same
      blush on another face, and the same impulse of compassion she had then
      felt made her turn her gaze away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock on the door broke the silence, and a porter put his head&rsquo; into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only just to know how many pieces there&rsquo;ll be to go down to the
      steamer in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the words she felt that the veil of painted gauze was torn in
      tatters, and that she was moving again among the grim edges of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I never <i>can</i> remember! Wait a minute; I
      shall have to ask my maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her bedroom door and called out: &ldquo;Annette!&rdquo;
